# LLM Classification Finetuning

Compare two responses to a shared prompt and predict **A wins, B wins, or tie**
for the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-classification-finetuning).

The project provides a saved prompt-grouped holdout, a Skywork LoRA
classifier, validation reports, full-data checkpoint builds, and submission
inference. Training uses **one CUDA GPU**; submission uses **two CUDA GPUs**.

## Start here

1. [Install the project](docs/getting-started.md) with Python 3.14+ and `uv`.
2. Use the saved processed split, or [prepare it from raw data](docs/data-preparation.md).
3. [Validate a model and inspect its report](docs/models.md).
4. Build a full-data checkpoint, then generate a submission in the
   [submission environment](docs/getting-started.md#submission-environment-pytorch-211--cuda-128).

For Colab and the local VS Code notebook workflow, see
[Colab setup and persistence](docs/colab.md).

## Model profiles

Selectors and YAML section names are case-sensitive.

| CLI selector | YAML section / checkpoint directory | Backbone and classifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SR2-Qwen3-4B-lora` | `SR2_Qwen3_4B_lora` | Skywork reward-trained Qwen3-4B LoRA; swap-equivariant three-class head |

SR2 is the only active model profile. It consumes the saved train/validation
split and trains and predicts on original rows only. The separate `warmup --build`
selector prepares an optional SR2 head-warmup cache. Retired Qwen profiles and
their historical artifacts are described in [migration](docs/migration.md).
